Dashboard Projects Report
Retail Business Performance & Financial KPI Analysis
Introduction
This report outlines two business intelligence projects focused on creating interactive Tableau dashboards to assist stakeholders in understanding and improving their business operations. The first project focuses on the retail sector, analyzing store-level performance, while the second centers around financial health monitoring for an early-stage startup.
Both dashboards were designed to provide real-time insights into key metrics such as sales, profit, inventory turnover, customer behavior, and financial KPIs like CAC, LTV, burn rate, and revenue trends.

Abstract
1.Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis
  This project involved analyzing retail transactional data from UT Discount Mart to uncover profit-draining categories, optimize inventory turnover, and study seasonal product behavior. The dashboard enabled dynamic filtering by month and year and provided breakdowns by category and region. An important assumption—that customers purchase two or more products per transaction—was validated using order-level data. Profit was estimated at 30% of the selling price.

2.Financial KPI Analysis for a Startup
  The goal of this project was to assess the financial sustainability of a startup by analyzing monthly revenue, customer acquisition cost (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), burn rate, and runway. The dashboard incorporated cohort analysis (monthly customer groups), LTV\:CAC ratio evaluation, and trend indicators for revenue performance. This allowed stakeholders to monitor key startup KPIs over time and adjust strategies accordingly.

Tools Used
Tableau– Dashboard creation and interactive visualizations of the data
