Project 1(Amazon Shipping)
Overview
Amazon Shipping is a company which ships a variety of FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) all over the world.

The Shipping Manager orders are processed and shipped on a monthly basis
I have taken csv files from an existing project idea from which I have createated a Dashboard for review so that could help in decisionmaking
I created below interactive dashboard as per perticular featurs
Now, you could switch and view different shipping stats for different months and years.

Project 2 (Sales Analysis)
Project Overview: UT Discount Mart Dashboard
This project involves building an interactive dashboard to provide insights into the performance of UT Discount Mart, a small supermarket. The dashboard is designed to track key business metrics such as Sales, Profit, and Quantity Sold for the current year.

The dashboard also provides analytical breakdowns by Product Category and Region, helping to identify trends and high-performing segments.

Additional insights include:
Verification of customer purchasing behavior, particularly the assumption that customers typically buy two or more products per order.
Profit calculations based on the assumption that profit constitutes 30% of the selling price.
The dashboard includes filtering capabilities that allow users to view shipping statistics across different months and years, enabling more detailed time-based analysis.
